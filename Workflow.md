## ðŸ§­ User Workflow

AlgoLab provides flexibility for users to **either upload their own dataset** or **generate synthetic data**. Every algorithm module follows a consistent flow to ensure ease of use and visualization clarity.

#### âœ… Steps Followed in Each Algorithm Section:

1. **Choose Dataset Source**
   - ðŸ“‚ Option 1: Upload a CSV file (with headers).
   - ðŸ”§ Option 2: Generate a synthetic dataset using built-in sliders and options.

2. **Preview or Display the Data**
   - View a snippet of the dataset (first few rows).
   - Option to display data statistics like shape, missing values, etc.

3. **Visualize Feature Relationships**
   - Select any feature for `X` and `Y` axis.
   - View scatter plots or distribution plots for visual intuition.

4. **Select and Apply Algorithm**
   - Choose from the list of supported ML algorithms based on the selected mode.
   - Train the model on the dataset.
   - Display relevant metrics (e.g., Accuracy, RÂ², Confusion Matrix) and visualization results.
